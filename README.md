# T2 Starter App

A boilerplate for creating Progressives Web Apps with React, TypeScript and Material-UI.

Boilerplate by [t2](https://github.com/Telehealth-and-Technology)

This boilerplate includes:
- [x] TypeScript 2.x
- [x] Redux, React-Redux
- [x] React-Router 4
- [x] Material-UI
- [x] Jest, Enzyme
- [x] Offline Plugin

## Prerequisites

Before starting you should be familiar with:

- [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) 
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- [React-Router V4.x](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy) 
- [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) 

## Getting Started
Clone the project:

``git clone https://github.com/jlightfoot2/t2-pwa-starter``

Install dependencies:

``yarn``

Start the development server at <i>localhost:8080</i>

``yarn start``

Run tests

``yarn test``

Build the app

``yarn build``

## Demo App

The boilerplate is set up with a demo app of an online store. Run the demo app by starting the development server.

## Purpose

The purpose of this starter app is to help developers more quickly build SPA/PWA apps at [T2](https://github.com/Telehealth-and-Technology).

## For Developers

This app contains components written to handle common features/issues for apps at t2. If you don't want to use them they can be easilily swapped out with you're own custom solution.

### Directory Structure Notes
#### src/components/

Containes the reusable components of this starter app. 
You probably won't need to edit most of these components 
but there are a couple exceptions:

#### src/components/AppRoutes.tsx

You will need to edit this file to include your own routes and views. In the future the routes will likely be moved to a more logical location

#### src/components/StoreDemo

This is just a directory that houses the store demo components. This was done to keep the demo related files separated from the rest of the project.


### Routing

One of the first places to look at to understand how an app like this works is to view
the top level routing. For this app this file is located here:

#### src/components/AppRoutes.tsx

This app uses react router version 4.

There were two components created that basically utilize react-router v4 and add some features including the ability to:


- Set the page title
- Set the left and or right icons of the app bar
- Add a [Tab](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/tabs) that links to the route
- Set the ink bar of a tab for a matched route


#### src/components/RouteGroup.tsx

The **RouteGroup** component is used in two primary things:

##### Number 1

- You can use it to establish the default properites of all **RouteItem** components nested within
**RouteGroup**. In the example below we pass an object to the property **defaultProps**. Any properties fed to **defaultProps** are passed to each **RouteItem**. This property is optional and is only provided to keep
things tidy. 

- In the example below each **RouteItem** will receive **basePath='/main'** and **title='Demo App!'**. Any properties added directly to *RouteItem* will have priority over the defaultProps added to **RouteGroup**. So in the 3rd **RouteItem** below the **title="Settings"** property will override **title="Demo App!"**

##### Number 2

- You need to pass the appPage object [more on this later]. **The appPage property is required for RouteGroup.**


```jsx
  <RouteGroup defaultProps={{basePath: '/main',title: 'Demo App!'}} appPage={appPage}>
    <RouteItem path="/" componentPage={<HomeComponent />} />
    <RouteItem exact path="/getstarted" componentPage={<GetStartedComponent />} />
    <RouteItem title={"Settings"} exact path="/setting" componentPage={<SettingsComponent />} />
  </RouteGroup>
```


#### src/components/RouteItem.tsx

RouteItem simply adds some features to the react-route v4 Route object. Plus adds some "goodies"
like creating tabs, hightlighting tabs, setting the title on for the app bar.

For example an app that has 3 routes and two tabs could be implemented with the code below.

```jsx
  <RouteGroup defaultProps={{title: 'Demo App!'}}>
    <RouteItem tab={0} title={"Home"} path="/" componentPage={<HomeComponent />} />
    <RouteItem tab={1} title={"Products"}exact path="/products" componentPage={<ProductsList />} />
    <RouteItem tabIndex={1} title={"Settings"} exact path="/product/:id" componentPage={<SettingsComponent />} />
  </RouteGroup>
```
The first two RouteItems create a tab merely by including a **tab** property and the desired tab index.
However notice that the 3rd route doesn't create a tab BUT when this route is active the "Products" tab will be 
active because we've included the **tabIndex** property which is passed an index number corresponding to the "Products" tab.

**Please keep in mind that if you are more comfortable using react-router v4 the standard way you wonâ€™t break the app by not using these components.**


### App Page interface

This interface is defined and implemented in **src/components/Main.tsx**

This is an inteface available to all components specified in each **RouteItem** instance.
It provides the capability to:

- Set the page title
- Set the left icon in the app bar
- Set the right icon in the app bar
- Manually create tabs.
- Provides screen dimensions for PWA purposes

Many of these functions are used "auto-magically" by **RouteItem**.

This interface provides other functions that might not be commonly used.
