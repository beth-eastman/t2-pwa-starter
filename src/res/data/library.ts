  {"id": 1, "title": "Introduction", "text": "<h2>1.1 Introduction</h2> An individual or a group of people are stigmatized if they are seen as different or worse off than their peers. Stigma can be rejection, discrimination, prejudice, or any other mode of separating people based on their characteristics or problems.<h2>1.1.1 Components of Stigma</h2> The modern concept of stigma has four necessary parts:<ol><li><b>Labeling someone with a condition </b><br>(e.g., saying someone is ―depressed‖)</li><li><b>Stereotyping people with that condition</b> <br>(e.g., thinking that every depressed person is ―weak‖)</li><li><b>Creating a division – a superior “us” group and a devalued “them” group, resulting in loss of status in the community</b> <br>(e.g., thinking ―unlike us, depressed people make lousy soldiers‖)</li><li><b>Discriminating against someone on the basis of their label</b> <br>(e.g., excluding a depressed colleague from after duty activities)</li></ol> All of these parts must exist together for someone to be stigmatized. For example, if a person is labeled by others, but that label does not lead to discrimination, this would not count as stigma.<h2>1.1.2 Self-Stigma and Shame</h2> Stigma is more than a label placed on someone by others. Individuals can label themselves negatively as well. We are all capable of judging ourselves harshly and unfairly.<h3>SHAME occurs when we believe that we must hide a part of ourselves that we judge to be unacceptable or we believe others will judge as unacceptable.</h3> Self-labeling amplifies shame. For example, if you believe that you are ―weak‖ and ―incompetent‖ because you cannot solve a problem like depression or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on your own, you are self-labeling and making the shame worse. Self-labeling can lead to the fear that others will come to the same conclusions about you if you seek help. This is often called <b><u>self-stigmatizing</u></b>."},
  {"id": 2, "title": "Stigma and the Military", "text": "<h2>1.2 Stigma and the Military</h2> Service members are often worried about stigma when they need to seek help for mental and physical deployment injuries. Service members are frequently concerned that going for treatment or getting labeled with a specific condition will lead to loss of security clearance, demotion, medical discharge, disrespect among unit members, disappointment from CO‘s, etc. This fear can keep service members (and sometimes their families) from seeking needed help. Here are some military-specific examples of the four parts of stigma:<ol><li><b>Labeling the person with the condition:</b> service members who seek counseling have been called names (e.g., 'weak,' 'head case,' 'whack job,' 'schizo').</li><li><b>Stereotyping based on the condition:</b> assumptions about service members‘ fitness for duty can come up (e.g., can be considered weak, unpredictable, or dangerous).</li><li><b>Creating a division between those with and those without the condition</b> (e.g., service members with adjustment challenges being excluded from off-duty activities or given different duty assignments)</li><li><b>Discriminating based on the condition</b> (e.g., Being passed over for promotion or not being given meaningful assignments because of adjustment challenges).).</li></ol><h2>1.2.1 Misperceptions That Can Lead To Stigma in the Military</h2> There are quite a few myths about mental and physical deployment injuries that can lead to stigma. These can be beliefs of commanding officers, other service members, families and friends, or the service member him/ herself. Unfortunately, there are many negative consequences of believing these incorrect assumptions. Here are just a few examples of <u>misperceptions</u> that can lead to stigma: Everyone who goes to war gets Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)<ul><li>PTSD is a lifelong illness that will be with you forever</li><li>CO‘s and respected service members don‘t struggle with post-deployment issues</li><li>People who seek professional help dishonor their families</li><li>Anyone who has seen a mental health professional is unfit for duty</li><li>Going for care will cause you to lose your security clearance</li><li>Anything you say in therapy or to your chaplain can be shared with your command</li><li>Courage in combat requires the absence of fear</li><li>People with brain injuries never get better</li><li>Only women get sexually assaulted</li><li>Thinking about suicide or having thoughts of death means a person will commit suicide</li><li>\"Real\" warriors can harden themselves to perform with little to no sleep</li><li>High calorie energy is all you need to perform well in combat</li><li>Effective managers excel at multi-tasking</li></ul><h2>1.2.2 The Consequences of Stigma</h2> Dealing with adjustment challenges after deployment is hard enough. Stigma adds another layer of difficulty for returning service members. Misperceptions and prejudices can lead to problems getting or keeping jobs and housing, among other things.<h3>Because service members might be stigmatized based on their deployment injuries, the possible negative consequences might include:</h3><ul><li>The fear of being stigmatized or rejected keeps many service members from talking to friends and family about their problems. This leads to isolation, loneliness, and shame. Plus, social support is extremely important when coping with deployment stresses; thus, service members would miss out on this important healing factor.<li>Service members who need treatment or counseling refuse to go get it because they are afraid of possible consequences for their careers, which can lead to years of avoidable suffering and negative outcomes.</li><li>Families of struggling returning veterans do not seek help for problems at home because they don‘t want to cast doubt on the service member‘s fitness for duty. Meanwhile, home life can become much more challenging than during the deployment.</li><li>While maintaining the ―secret‖ of the returning member‘s difficulties, relationship problems can emerge between the service member and family or friends.</li><li>Instead of asking for help, service members with post-deployment challenges start giving up on personal goals that now seem out of reach. Friends, family, colleagues, and even the service members themselves can become disappointed and angry with the changes.</li><li>Even with the best efforts to mask problems, work can suffer and struggling service members can be ―found out‖ by command or by colleagues. This often leads to worse outcomes than when people self-refer to get help.</li></ul><h2>1.2.3 Stigma and Suicide</h2> When fear of stigma interferes with seeking help, it can cause serious problems. Studies show that recent returnees are at an increased risk for suicide. Out of 100,000 service members from all branches, between 11 and 20 committed suicide in 2008 (the exact estimate depends on the branch). These numbers are significantly higher than the civilian population and there is reason to believe that many deaths could be avoided if service members felt comfortable asking for help.<h2>1.2.4 Stigma and Suicide</h2> Top brass report that negative career consequences for seeking mental health services are fairly uncommon in reality. A recent study showed that of the service members who self-referred for mental health treatment, only three percent had a negative career impact. In comparison, 39 percent of service members who were referred by their commanders had a negative career impact.<br><br> Colonel Scott Marrs, Ph.D., Chief of the Air Force‘s mental health division said: “Seeking mental health care doesn’t harm your career. It’s not being able to do your job because of personal issues that can harm your career.”<br><br> And while many service members worry that their security clearance will be revoked if they see a behavioral health professional, the truth is that less than one percent of those investigated for clearances are rejected solely on the basis of their mental health profiles. In fact, in May 2008, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced that the Department of Defense had revised “the infamous question 21” on its security clearance questionnaire. Now, people who seek help for combat-related issues or who receive marital counseling don‘t have to answer \"yes\" when asked if they have ever “consulted with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health condition.”<h4><u>Read it for yourself</u></h4> See General Ham and General Patton describe how they received help for PTSD symptoms without it harming their careers:<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2008-11-24-general_N.htm\">http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2008-11-24-general_N.htm</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.militaryinfo.com/news_story.cfm?textnewsid=2951\">http://www.militaryinfo.com/news_story.cfm?textnewsid=2951</a></li></ul><h4><u>Hear and see it for yourself</u></h4> Watch service members discuss their decision to seek help:<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.realwarriors.net/multimedia/profiles.php\">http://www.realwarriors.net/multimedia/profiles.php</a></li></ul><h4>1.2.5 Choose to Combat Stigma</h4>Help is available to you. You have bravely served and sacrificed for your country and it is your right to receive care and support. It is in your best interest, and the interest of your family, friends, and mission for you to get the help you need. A safe and effective force is strong and mentally healthy. There is courage in asking for help, strength in learning to manage struggles, and pride in moving on from challenges."},
  {"id": 3, "title": "Overcoming Stigma", "text": "<h2>1.3 Overcoming Stigma</h2> If you find that you are avoiding seeking help because of concern about how you will be viewed by others (stigma) or because you are judging yourself negatively (shame and self-stigma), it may be worth examining your decision in light of the following information.<h2>1.3.1 Catastrophic Thinking</h2> In a combat environment, you were taught to think through worst case-scenarios. In unpredictable and dangerous situations this is a critical survival skill. It allows you to anticipate and prepare for even the most unlikely events. In the non-combat environment, the tendency to think of unlikely worst-case scenarios can actually make more trouble than it prevents. Here are some examples of thoughts that pertain to getting help:<ul><li>\"I will be ridiculed for seeking help.\"<li>\"I will be shunned by my friends and co-workers for being weak.\"</li><li>\"My command will lose confidence in me.\"</li><li>\"I will lose my security clearance.\"</li><li>\"I will be demoted because I can‘t 'suck it up and push on‘\"</li></ul> If you continue to worry that something bad will happen if you get help, even in the face of realistic information that it probably won‘t, you are using catastrophic thinking. Catastrophic or \"worst case scenario\" thinking uses your imagination to distort reality in a way that scares you unnecessarily.<i>“I can’t let anybody know that I’m depressed and having nightmares because it proves I’m not as strong as everyone else.”</i> Thinking something will probably happen when you have little evidence to support the thought, will prevent you from receiving the help and support you need. You will feel powerless and out of control in the face of a solvable personal struggle because you are confusing what might possibly happen with what will probably happen.<br><br> When you focus in on what is possible rather than on what is likely or probable, you end up getting trapped by your thoughts, because they can never be challenged or refuted. If you believe that anything is possible (as it is in a combat environment), you are forced to always prepare for the worst case scenario. When you need professional care because of mental or physical injuries sustained during deployment, this \"anything is possible\" mindset can lead you to fear seeking appropriate help. In a noncombat environment, failure to distinguish between what is possible and what is probable prevents progress.<h2>1.3.2 Realistic Thinking</h2> Realistic thinking takes into consideration what is probably going to happen instead of only focusing on the best or worst case scenario. For example, while it is possible that you will be killed next time you drive your car, you have learned to ignore that possibility and drive anyway. While it is possible that the next time that you eat in a restaurant you could suffer food poisoning, you have learned to ignore that possibility and you eat in restaurants anyway. You make your decisions based on what is most likely, not what could happen or what might happen."},
